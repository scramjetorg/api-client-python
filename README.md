The package provides an API Clients for use with Scramjet Transform Hub.


# Development guide

The best option to develop API clients is to create virtual environments for each of the client itself. Go to one of the clients directory, **client**, **manager_client**, **multimanager_client**, **middleware_client** and run:

````bash
# create virtual env
python3 -m venv venv

# activate
source venv/bin/activate

# install dependencies
pip install -r requirements_dev.txt
````

# BDD tests

We prepared basic BDD tests with Python Behave. You can read more about it [here](https://behave.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html)

For now, BDD tests are written only for **client**. To run, you need also install our STH platform. You can follow the guide from [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@scramjet/sth).

As you have installed STH, activate virtual env, install dependencies from **requirements_dev.txt** and run **behave** directly from **client** directory. You need also to download testing files from our refapps directory. You can just use our simple script from this repository. It will download all necessary files to **refapps** directory.


````bash
# download refapps
./download-refapps.sh
cd client/

# run bdd tests
behave
````

You should be able to see something similar
